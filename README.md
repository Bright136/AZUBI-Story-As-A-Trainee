# ðŸ“ˆðŸ§ª Data Analytics Program ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š : Story of *Bright Ofori Boye Eshun*
This readme is to share my story and experiences as a trainee in the Azubi Data Analytics Program.


## Let me introduce Myself
I am XX YY, a petroleum engineering graduate who has always been passionate about technology. I enrolled in the Azubi training program after hearing a colleague's testimonial. Previously, I worked as an e-banking officer in a bank until I made the decision to resign and fully pursue a career in technology. While I initially enrolled in several programs, I had to drop out because they were not suitable for beginners. Fortunately, I applied for the Azubi program and was selected as one of the fortunate trainees. This marked the beginning of my journey to become a Data Scientist.


## How would I describe my experience in the data analytics program ?
I would describe my experience in the Azubi program as challenging and demanding. When I enrolled in the program, I was already juggling multiple other programs, which made it even more difficult. Azubi had strict deadlines for assignments and individual projects, and it became overwhelming for me at times. There was a moment when I felt like giving up and dropping out. However, after speaking with a few colleagues, they motivated me to keep pushing forward because this program offered everything I had been looking for in a comprehensive package.


## How would I say the Career Accelerator phase has introduced me to when it comes to data analytics ?Â 
The career accelerator program opened up a world of possibilities for me. It taught me valuable skills such as resume formatting, structuring, and the art of incorporating keywords from job profiles into my resume. We were encouraged to apply for roles that typically required a certain number of years of experience, even if we didn't meet those requirements, and instead let our skills speak for themselves. This approach empowered us to showcase our abilities and demonstrate how we could contribute effectively in those roles.

## What enticed me to join the Data Analytics Program?
While working at the bank, I decided to enroll in a short data science course offered by Hotspot Academy. It was during this course that I discovered the trainer, Franklin, who had received his training from Azubi. I was impressed by his teaching style and depth of understanding in the field. A friend of mine also shared a testimonial about his cousin who successfully secured a job after completing the Azubi program. My friend himself had enrolled in the program and was thoroughly enjoying it, but unfortunately had to drop out due to personal reasons. Although I couldn't complete the Hotspot Academy course at that time due to my work schedule, I had already made up my mind to join Azubi the next time they opened applications.

## What would I say my progress in tech has been since joining the program ?Â 
Since joining the Azubi program, I have made significant progress in my tech journey, particularly in terms of achieving a higher level of autonomy. One of my fears before embarking on this path was not being able to handle projects independently. However, I can confidently say that the training approach at Azubi has helped me develop a certain level of autonomy. We are often introduced to new libraries and given projects to build using them. This requires diving into documentation and learning to navigate unfamiliar technologies. Through this process, I have gained confidence as both a Data Scientist and a Python programmer. I can now tackle projects with a greater sense of self-reliance and assurance.

## What are my plans for the future ?
In the future, my plans are to become a full stack software engineer and a tech entrepreneur. However, in the present, I am focused on finding a role as a Python developer or data scientist. I believe that such a position will provide me with valuable opportunities to enhance my skills, work on real-life projects, and further refine my abilities. By gaining hands-on experience and tackling practical challenges, I aim to sharpen my expertise and develop a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the tech industry.

## What is my dream company or role ?
My dream company is Google, and my ultimate career goal is to become a software engineer and eventually progress into a management role within the company. I am highly motivated to work in a dynamic and innovative environment like Google, which fosters creativity and encourages continuous learning. As a software engineer, I aspire to contribute to cutting-edge projects, solve complex problems, and develop impactful solutions. With dedication, hard work, and a focus on personal growth, I hope to realize my dream of joining Google and making a meaningful impact in the field of technology.

It's essential to set realistic expectations and understand that the learning journey is ongoing. By committing to consistent effort and staying dedicated to your goals, you can make steady progress and build a solid foundation of knowledge and skills.

    Remember, the tech industry is vast and ever-evolving, so it's important to focus on continuous growth and keep up with the latest trends and technologies.

These sessions served as invaluable stepping stones in my journey, fostering a deep passion for programming and instilling in me a profound sense of accomplishment.

4. Are the lectures engaging and interesting? 

    The lecturers at Azubi were captivating and engaging. There were moments when we wished we could extract every bit of knowledge from them to expedite our project development. However, they often challenged us to figure things out on our own, encouraging independent problem-solving. Reflecting on those experiences, I realize that this approach, although tough at times, played a significant role in enhancing my skills. The exhilaration I feel when I successfully troubleshoot and resolve an error message is indescribable. Embracing the learning process and deriving insights from mistakes has become an integral part of my journey. It has not only contributed to my growth but also instilled a sense of resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges. 

5. What happens if you miss a lecture? 

    If you miss a lecture you deducted points for attendance but they recordings for you to watch later.

6. What do you think of the flexibility of the program? 

    I can't provide extensive insight on this matter as my personal experience was challenging due to being enrolled in other programs simultaneously. However, I did observe that some fellow trainees genuinely expressed concerns regarding the program's flexibility, particularly those who were balancing work commitments alongside their studies. It is important to acknowledge that individuals have different circumstances and obligations, which can impact their ability to fully engage with the program. While I cannot speak for everyone, it is evident that some trainees faced difficulties in managing their work and program requirements concurrently.

7. Do the projects worked on help you test your ability / skills? 

    Absolutely, the projects I worked on during the program played a vital role in allowing me to put my skills and abilities to the test. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to tackle these projects and witness the progress I made along the way.

It taught me the valuable lesson that sometimes, despite lacking certain skills or having a less-than-ideal project, it is crucial to submit and showcase my work nonetheless. I believe this approach was designed not only to assess our progress but also to identify areas where additional support and guidance could be offered to trainees.I have learned the importance of consistency and unwavering determination. It has instilled in me the mindset of continuously striving for improvement and growth.
